# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Import the `lu` function from the `scipy.linalg` package.
2. Get input from the user and print the L and U matrices using the `print` function.
3. Import `lu_factor` and `lu_solve` from the `scipy.linalg` package and create a variable `X` to include these functions.
4. Print the variable `X` and end program.

## Program:
(i) To find the L and U matrix
